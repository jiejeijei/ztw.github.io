        What is true friendship? It is not about how many friends you have, but about the quality of the connection.
         A true friend is someone who listens to you when you are happy or sad. 
         They offer support when things get tough and share joy in your successes.
        <br><br>Friendship is like a small boat on the ocean. When the sea is calm, you enjoy the ride together. 
        When storms come, you help each other to stay safe and strong. Remember, being a good friend is just as important as having one.
         It requires trust, honesty, and kindness. 
         Treasure your friends, for they make your life journey more beautiful.
